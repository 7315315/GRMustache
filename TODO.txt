Known bug:

A side-effect of the implementation of variadic filters has GRMustache
behave the same for both `f(a,b)` and `f(a)(b)` expressions. You should not
rely on this behavior, which may change in future releases.

However, this
also implies that a variadic filter can not return a filter: `f(a,b)(c)` is
equivalent to `f(a,b,c)`, and the `f` filter can not return a filter that
would apply to the `c` value.
