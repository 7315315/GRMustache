It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"UA-33073809-1","name":"GRMustache","body":"GRMustache is an Objective-C implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) logic-less template language.\r\n\r\nThe Mustache syntax: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html.\r\n\r\nBreaking news on Twitter: http://twitter.com/GRMustache\r\n\r\n\r\nHow To\r\n------\r\n\r\n### 1. Download and add to your Xcode project\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.git\r\n\r\n- For MacOS 10.6+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache4-MacOS.a` to your project.\r\n- For iOS3+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache4-iOS.a` to your project.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods): append `dependency 'GRMustache'` to your Podfile. In its current version, CocoaPods exposes private headers that you should not rely on, because future versions of GRMustache may change them, without notice, in an incompatible fashion. Make sure you only import `GRMustache.h`.\r\n\r\n### 2. Import \"GRMustache.h\" and start rendering templates\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n#import \"GRMustache.h\"\r\n\r\n// Renders \"Hello Arthur!\"\r\nNSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@\"Arthur\"]\r\n                                            fromString:@\"Hello {{name}}!\"\r\n                                                 error:NULL];\r\n\r\n// Renders from a resource\r\nNSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@\"Arthur\"]\r\n                                          fromResource:@\"Profile\"  // loads `Profile.mustache`\r\n                                                bundle:nil\r\n                                                 error:NULL];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nGRMustache online documentation is provided as guides and sample code:\r\n\r\n- [Guides/templates.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/templates.md): how to load, parse, and render templates from various sources\r\n- [Guides/runtime.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime.md): how to provide data to templates\r\n- [Guides/delegate.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md): how to hook into template rendering\r\n- [Guides/sample_code.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code.md): because some tasks are easier to do with some guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n- **Q: How do I render array indexes?**\r\n    \r\n    A: Check [Guides/sample_code/indexes.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/indexes.md)\r\n\r\n- **Q: How do I implement filters, format numbers, dates, etc?**\r\n    \r\n    A: Check documentation of [Mustache lambda sections](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/helpers.md) first. If it would not help, maybe you'll get some inspiration from the [number formatting sample code](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/number_formatting.md). If you are still stuck after those, go and look for a [closed issue](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/issues?state=closed) that covers your need. Finally, open a new issue :-)\r\n\r\n- **Q: How do I render default values for missing keys?**\r\n\r\n    A: This can be done by providing your template a delegate: check [Guides/delegate.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md).\r\n\r\n- **Q: I have a bunch of template partials that live in memory, not in the file system. How do I include them?**\r\n    \r\n    A: Check [Guides/template_repositories.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/template_repositories.md).\r\n\r\n- **Q: What is this NSUndefinedKeyException stuff?**\r\n\r\n    A: When GRMustache has to try several objects until it finds the one that provides a `{{key}}`, several NSUndefinedKeyException are raised and caught. Let us double guess you: it's likely that you wish Xcode would stop breaking on those exceptions. This use case is covered in [Guides/runtime/context_stack.md](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime/context_stack.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nContribution wish-list\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nI wish somebody would review my non-native English, and clean up the guides, if you ask.\r\n\r\n\r\nForking\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease fork.
