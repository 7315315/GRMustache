 * List the name of the keys GRMustache can access on this class.

 * Your object should implement this method to fine-tune the values GRMustache
 * can access using `valueForKey:` and `objectForKeyedSubscript:`.
 *
 * When objects do not respond to this method, all keys can be accessed through
 * `objectForKeyedSubscript:`, and only declared properties can be
 * accessed by `valueForKey:` (except for CoreData NSManagedObjects where all
 * CoreData properties are also accessible, even without property declaration).
 *
 * **Companion guide:** https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/security.md
