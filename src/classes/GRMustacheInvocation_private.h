/**
 * The GRMustacheInvocation class is the NSInvocation of GRMustache.
 *
 * Whenever Mustache has to render, say, a tag such as `{{foo.bar}}`, it has
 * to invoke the `foo` key in the current context stack, then the `bar` key, and
 * render the returned value.
 *
 * The GRMustacheInvocation encapsulates this whole process.
 * 
 * Instances are created by GRMustacheCompiler, and stored by rendering
 * elements that query the user data: GRMustacheVariableElement and
 * GRMustacheSectionElement.
 *
 * A rendering element would send the `invokeWithContext:` message to its
 * invocation. The invocation would perform the key lookup in the context stack,
 * and set its return value. The rendering element would the process this return
 * value.
 *
 * Invocations are exposed to the template's delegate: library users can modify
 * the return value of invocations, and alter the template rendering.
