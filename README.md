GRMustache
==========

GRMustache is an Objective-C implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) logic-less template engine.

The Mustache syntax: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html (not wrong, but somewhat outdated).

What you get
------------

**MacOS 10.6+, iPhoneOS 3.0, iOS 4.0+ support**

**An ARC-compatible static library**, that will run on your computers, devices, simulators.

**Compatibility with other Mustache implementations**: [Mustache specification v1.1.2](https://github.com/mustache/spec) conformance.
    
**Compatibility with previous GRMustache versions**: update GRMustache, enjoy [performance improvements](https://github.com/groue/GRMustacheBenchmark) and bugfixes, and don't change a line of your code. You may get harmless deprecation warnings, though. Check the [release notes](GRMustache/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

**Documentation**: GRMustache online documentation is provided as guides:

- [guides/embedding.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/embedding.md): how to embed GRMustache in your Xcode projects
- [guides/templates.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/templates.md): how to parse and render templates
- [guides/runtime.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/runtime.md): how to provide data to templates
- [guides/delegate.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/delegate.md): how to hook into template rendering
- [guides/forking.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/forking.md): how GRMustache is organized

**Sample code**: because some tasks are easier to do with some guidelines.

- [SampleCode/NumberFormatting](GRMustache/blob/master/SampleCode/NumberFormatting): how to use NSNumberFormatter instances to format numbers in sections of your templates.


Usage
-----

GRMustache rendering is the combination of a template string and of an object that will provide the data.

You can render templates on the fly:

    #import "GRMustache.h"
    
    NSString *templateString = @"Hello {{name}}!";
    Person *arthur = [Person personWithName:@"Arthur"];
    
    // Renders "Hello Arthur!"
    NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:arthur fromString:templateString error:NULL];

You can also parse a template once, and render it many times.

    GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMustacheTemplate templateFromString:templateString error:NULL];
    rendering = [template renderObject:arthur];
    rendering = [template renderObject:...];

Speaking of templates, GRMustache eats many kinds of them: files and bundle resources as well as raw strings. For more information, check [guides/templates.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/templates.md).

Regarding the data objects, GRMustache fetches values with the standard Key-Value Coding `valueForKey:` method. Check [guides/runtime.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/runtime.md).
