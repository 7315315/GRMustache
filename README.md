GRMustache
==========

GRMustache is an Objective-C implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) logic-less template engine.

The Mustache syntax: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html (not wrong, but somewhat outdated).

Three steps to GRMustache
-------------------------

### 1. Download GRMustache

    $ git clone https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.git

### 2. Embed GRMustache in your Xcode project

- For MacOS 10.6+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache1-macosx10.6.a` to your project.
- For iOS4+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache1-ios4.a` to your project.
- For iOS3+ development, add `include/GRMustache.h` and `lib/libGRMustache1-ios3.a` to your project.

### 3. Import "GRMustache.h" and start rendering templates

```objc
#import "GRMustache.h"

// Renders "Hello Arthur!"
NSString *rendering = [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Arthur"]
                                            fromString:@"Hello {{name}}!"
                                                 error:NULL];
```


Why GRMustache?
---------------

GRMustache conforms to the [Mustache specification v1.1.2](https://github.com/mustache/spec).

GRMustache respects your code: update GRMustache, enjoy [performance improvements](https://github.com/groue/GRMustacheBenchmark) and bugfixes, and don't change a line of your code. You may get harmless deprecation warnings, though (check the [release notes](GRMustache/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md)).

GRMustache online documentation is provided as guides and sample code:

- [Guides/templates.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/templates.md): how to parse and render templates
- [Guides/runtime.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/runtime.md): how to provide data to templates
- [Guides/delegate.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/delegate.md): how to hook into template rendering
- [Guides/sample_code.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code.md): because some tasks are easier to do with some guidelines.
- [Guides/forking.md](GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/forking.md): how GRMustache is organized
