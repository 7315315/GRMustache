GRMustache
==========

GRMustache is an Objective-C implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) logic-less template engine.

The Mustache syntax: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html (not wrong, but somewhat outdated).

What you get
------------

**An ARC-compatible static library**, that will run on your computers, devices, simulators.

**MacOS 10.6+, iPhoneOS 3.0, iOS 4.0+ support**

**Compatibility with other Mustache implementations**: [Mustache specification v1.1.2](https://github.com/mustache/spec) conformance, and a touch of [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) (details in [guides/flavors.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/flavors.md)).
    
**Compatibility with previous GRMustache versions**: update GRMustache, enjoy performance improvements and bugfixes, and don't change a line of your code. Check the [release notes](GRMustache/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

**Number and date formatting.** Handy, and built-in.

**Documentation**: GRMustache online documentation is provided as guides. The first one tells you how to embed GRMustache in your XCode project: [guides/embedding.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/embedding.md).


Usage
-----

GRMustache rendering is the combination of a template string and of an object that will provide the data.

You can render templates on the fly:

    #import "GRMustache.h"
    
    NSString *templateString = @"Hello {{name}}!";
    Person *arthur = [Person personWithName:@"Arthur"];
    
    // Returns "Hello Arthur!"
    [GRMustacheTemplate renderObject:arthur
                          fromString:templateString
                               error:NULL];

You can also parse a template once, and render it many times.

    GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMustacheTemplate parseString:templateString error:NULL];
    [template renderObject:arthur];
    [template renderObject:...];

Speaking of templates, GRMustache eats many kinds of them: files and bundle resources as well as raw strings. For more information, check [guides/templates.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/templates.md).

Regarding the data objects, GRMustache fetches values with the standard Key-Value Coding `valueForKey:` method. Check [guides/runtime.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/runtime.md).

Mustache flavors
----------------

GRMustache supports two Mustache flavors : the genuine Mustache, and a bit a [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js).

The main difference lies in the syntax of key paths: genuine Mustache reads `{{foo.bar.baz}}`, while Handlebars reads `{{foo/bar/baz}}` and even `{{../foo/bar/baz}}`.

If your templates use such compound key paths, you should read [guides/flavors.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/flavors.md).


Features worth noting
---------------------

### Lambda sections

Mustache has "lambda sections". These are sections that allow you to execute custom code, and implement nifty features like caching, filtering, whatever, on portions of your templates.

Be sure to read GRMustache's take on the subject: [guides/runtime/helpers.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/runtime/helpers.md).

### Number and Date formatting

GRMustache ships with a few helper classes. One allows you to format all numbers in a section with a `NSNumberFormatter` instance, the other does the same, for dates.

They are covered by [guides/number_formatting.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/number_formatting.md) and  [guides/date_formatting.md](GRMustache/blob/master/guides/date_formatting.md)
