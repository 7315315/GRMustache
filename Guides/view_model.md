Patterns For Feeding GRMustache Templates
=========================================

ViewModels
----------

GRMustache fetches values with the [Key-Value Coding](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html) `valueForKey:` method. Any compliant object can provide values to templates. Dictionaries are, and generally all your objects (see the [Runtime Guide](runtime.md) for more information):

```objc
GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMustacheTemplate templateFromString:@"{{name}}" error:NULL];

// Arthur
[template renderObject:@{ @"name": @"Arthur" } error:NULL];

// Bernard
[template renderObject:[Person personWithName:@"Bernard"] error:NULL];
```

The rendered object is sometimes called, in the Mustache lingo, a *ViewModel*.

This is because its methods and properties define an interface to the template to be rendered. It's a model of the template, just as your Person class is a model of an actual person. A method or key `name` matches a `{{ name }}` tag just as it matches a person's name. And because a template belongs to the View realm, we eventually settle on the "ViewModel" name.


Custom ViewModel Classes
------------------------

In practice, it's very common to reuse an existing class, such as an all too plain Controller or Model object, as the ViewModel of a template. The controller or the model object has not been particularly designed to fit a template. Rather you write the template with carefully chosen keys that match your object's method.

However, eventually, templates need some very specific data that are uneasy to fit in those objects:

- values derived from others, such as formatted numbers and dates, or custom properties.
- default values when one is missing.

For instance, consider the following template:

`Document.mustache`

    {{# user }}
        {{ name }} ({{ age }})
        Member since {{ fullDateFormat(joinDate) }}
    {{/ user }}

Let's design a custom ViewModel class:

`Document.h`

```objc
// Public interface to the Document.mustache template
@interface Document : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) User *user;   // The rendered user
@end
```

`Document.m`

```objc
@implementation Document

// Some users don't have any name.
// Provides a default name for those anonymous users.
- (NSString *)name
{
    return @"Anonymous";
}

// The User class does not have any `age` property.
// Instead, they have a `birthDate` property.
- (NSUInteger)age
{
    NSDate *birthDate = self.user.birthDate;
    return /* clever computation based on user's birth date */;
}

// The `fullDateFormat` filter.
- (NSDateFormatter *)fullDateFormat
{
    NSDateFormatter *fullDateFormat = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
    fullDateFormat.dateStyle = NSDateFormatterLongStyle;
    return fullDateFormat;
}

@end
```

The rendering:

```objc
- (NSString *)rendering
{
    // Load Document.mustache
    GRMustacheTemplate *template = [GRMsutacheTemplate templateFromResource:@"Document" bundle:nil error:NULL];
    
    // Initialize Document object
    Document *document = [[Document alloc] init];
    document.user = self.user;
    
    // Render
    return [template renderObject:document error:NULL];
}
```

Subclasses of GRMustacheContext
-------------------------------

The Document class above was a plain subclass of NSObject.

You may also subclass `GRMustacheContext`, and have access to a few extra features:

1. more flexibility for computing derived values.
2. default value for any key.
3. easier template debugging.

Let's consider this other template, and see what we can do with GRMustacheContext subclasses.

`Document.mustache`

    {{# user }}
        {{ name }} ({{ age }})
        
        {{ #pets }}
        - {{ name }} ({{ age }})
        {{ /pets }}
    {{/ user }}


### Deriving Values From the Context Stack

The [context stack](runtime.md#the-context-stack) is the stack of objects that are available for providing values to templates.

Inside the `{{# user }}...{{/ user }}` section, the user is at the top of the context stack: he will provide template keys.

Inside the `{{# pets }}...{{/ pets }}` section, each user's pet on its turn gets at the top of the context stack: it will provide template keys, and leave the ones it doesn't know to the user.

GRMustacheContext subclasses can load values for the context stack. This will help us rendering the `{{ age }}` tags: first with the user's birth date, then with the pets'.

`Document.h`

```objc
@interface Document : GRMustacheContext
@property (nonatomic, strong) User *user;   // The rendered user
@end
```

`Document.m`

```objc
@implementation Document
@dynamic user;      // more on that below

- (NSUInteger)age
{
    // Load user's or pet's birth date
    NSDate *birthDate = [self valueForMustacheKey:@"birthDate"];
    return /* clever computation based on the birth date */;
}

@end
```

`valueForMustacheKey:` looks in the context stack for an object that provides the given key, and returns this value. It returns nil if the key could not be resolved. Generally speaking, it returns the value that would be rendered by a tag containing a single identifier: `[context valueForMustacheKey:@"xxx"]` returns the value rendered by `{{ xxx }}`.

You may also need to fetch the value of more complex Mustache expressions such as `user.name` or `uppercase(user.name)`. This is the job of the `valueForMustacheExpression:error:` method.


### Dynamic properties

Be cautious: when implementing a GRMustacheContext subclass, the properties that are available to the templates, such as the `user` property above, *must* be declared as @dynamic.

You can also declare read-only @dynamic properties. Those give you straight access to the context stack, just as the `valueForMustacheKey:` method:

`Document.h`

```objc
@interface Document : GRMustacheContext
@property (nonatomic, strong) User *user;           // The rendered user
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSDate *birthDate   // The current birth date
@end
```

`Document.m`

```objc
@implementation Document
@dynamic user, birthDate;

- (NSUInteger)age
{
    return /* clever computation based on the self.birthDate */;
}

@end
```

### Default values for any key

The `valueForUndefinedMustacheKey:` method lets you provide a default value for any key. It is triggered when no object in the context stack would provide a value for a given key.

`Document.m`

```objc
@implementation Document

- (id)valueForUndefinedMustacheKey:(NSString *)key
{
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"<default %@>", key];
}

@end
```

### Template debugging

A note about Key-Value Coding
-----------------------------

GRMustacheContext does not mess with Key-Value Coding, and leaves `valueForKey:` untouched.

**The rule of thumb** is simple: to get the value that would be rendered by a tag `{{ ... }}`, avoid `valueForKey:`, and use `valueForMustacheKey:` or `valueForMustacheExpression:error:`.

Some readers may think:

> Why did he introduce this weird valueForMustacheKey: method? Why didn't he just override valueForKey:? Key-Value Coding is sooo cool, this looks like a missed opportunity.

Well, I have tried, really hard, to inject Mustache into KVC, and throw a nonchalant "just use valueForKey:" is this Guide.

But the [rule of least surprise](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878339) eventually gets broken. The most daring readers, and the [future me](http://xkcd.com/302/), will be interested in this [detailed rationale](view_model_vs_kvc.md).


Compatibility with other Mustache implementations
-------------------------------------------------

[Many Mustache implementations](https://github.com/defunkt/mustache/wiki/Other-Mustache-implementations) foster the ViewModel concept, and encourage you to write your custom subclasses.

GRMustache implementation follows closely the behavior of the [canonical Ruby implementation](https://github.com/defunkt/mustache).

However, this topic is not mentioned in the [Mustache specification](https://github.com/mustache/spec).

**If your goal is to design ViewModels that remain compatible with other Mustache implementations, check their documentation.**
