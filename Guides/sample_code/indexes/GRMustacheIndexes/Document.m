     * - isOdd: YES if the position of the person is odd
     * - isFirst: YES if the person is the first of the people array.

     * filters to be an instance of the PositionFilter class. That class has
     * been implemented so that it provides us with the extra keys for free.
     *
     * For now, we just declare our template.
